# Project Name
SQL To-Do List

## Description
This is a simple jQuery to-do list app that allows the user to enter a task, assign that task a priority value, and either mark it complete, or delete it. All the information is stored in a local database using SQL.  The mark complete button changes the visual of the button from orange to green, so the user knows it is complete. Useful for endorphin creation whenever needed (always?).
